        <span class="pink">Paddle for the Cure</span> is a special support organization for breast cancer survivors.  We offer a
        unique survivorship program that uses recreational dragon boat paddling to manage treatment side effects for
        breast cancer survivors and promotes a positive and healthy lifestyle.
      </p>
      <p class="text-left">
        Organized by survivors ourselves, we paddle our way to recovery with each other and a tremendous group of
        supporters and paddling enthusiasts along our side. Our on-water season is May through October.  Off-season
        indoor practices are available November through April.  We plan to practice weekly in the Worldâ€™s Fair
        Marina and participate in Dragon Boat races along the East Coast.

        A portion of our proceeds go to Komen Greater New York City for their support.

        Our team events are open to all and they promote a healthy lifestyle, a way of getting life and movement back
        through emotional support, team spirit and exercise.
